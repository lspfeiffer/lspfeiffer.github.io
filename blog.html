                    <p> WHile in London over J-term, one of the coolest places that I went to was Harrods.  While I suppose that speaks a lot about my materialistic side, i'll leave that discussion for another post.  Basically Harrod's is a super department store.  Everything is extremely high priced but high quality.  In addition to seeing some super cool Porsches, I saw stuff that would boggle your mind.  Watches that cosst over 200 thousand dollars, a gold xbox, iPads and iPhones embedded with crystals.  Just amazing stuff.</p>

                    <p>When I was in London for J-Term I was lucky enought to go see a BPL Game.  I watched as Tottenhame beat Crystal Palace with a score of two to nil.  Being at WHite Hart Lane was awe inspiring.  The fans were so dedicated and they had such a team mentality.  I really think there is something that we can learn from people who supposrt a team, no matter who is on it..</p>

                    <p>Seeing the Tower of London was pretty amazign.  I've always heard so much about it from stories and history classes but actually being there was a whole different experience.  We got to see the crown jewels and learn more about the history of some of the British monarchs.  Turns out that a lot of gifts were given to the kings and queens in the form of animals.  It was funny to imagine how a Polar Bear would fare in the temporate British climate.</p>
